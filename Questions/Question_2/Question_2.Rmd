# Introduction {-}

In this section, data on the ALSI and SWIX top 40 Indexes is used to conduct analysis. The performance of stocks will be compared, and stratification (using data on the USDZAR rate) will be used to compare the return profiles of these indeces during periods of low and high currency volatility. 

# Data {-}

```{r, include=FALSE}
T40 <- read_rds("/Users/tiagob/Documents/Masters 2021/Second Semester/Financial Econometrics/data/T40.rds")
Reb_Days <- read_rds("/Users/tiagob/Documents/Masters 2021/Second Semester/Financial Econometrics/data/Rebalance_days.rds")
USDZAR <- read_rds("/Users/tiagob/Documents/Masters 2021/Second Semester/Financial Econometrics/data/usdzar.rds")
```

T40 is a variable containing data on daily stock returns, as well as information on the ALSI (J200) and SWIX (J400) stock indexes. In addition, to supplement this analysis, data on the USDZAR spot rate is loaded (called USDZAR) in order to perform stratification, and analyze the behavior of the indexes during periods of currency volatility. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
T40_info <- left_join(T40 %>% select(Short.Name) %>% unique() %>% mutate(N=(1:92)),
                      T40 %>% select(Tickers) %>% unique() %>% mutate(N=(1:92)),
                      by="N") %>% select(-N) %>% arrange(Tickers)

T40 <- T40 %>% rename("ALSI"=J200) %>% rename("SWIX"=J400) %>% select(-Short.Name)

T40$Tickers <- gsub(" SJ Equity", "", T40$Tickers)

    
```

Checking for missing values in returns yields `r sum(is.na(T40$Return))`. There were, however, `r sum(is.na(T40$SWIX))` missing values for the J400, and `r sum(is.na(T40$ALSI))` missing values for the J200. Before proceeding, need to impute these missing returns; using the mean value of the respected index, and the coalesce function. 

```{r, include=FALSE}

T40 <- T40 %>% group_by(date) %>% 
    mutate(Avg1=mean(SWIX, na.rm=T)) %>%
    mutate(Avg1=coalesce(Avg1, 0)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(SWIX=coalesce(SWIX, Avg1)) %>%
    mutate(Avg2=mean(ALSI, na.rm=T)) %>%
    mutate(Avg2=coalesce(Avg2, 0)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(ALSI=coalesce(ALSI, Avg2)) %>%
    select(-Avg1, -Avg2)


```

There are now no missing values for the respective indexes. 
Secondly, for this discussion only stocks that have data for the full sample period (2 January 2008-29 October 2021) will be considered. Initially, there were 92 tickers in total.

```{r, include=FALSE}

T40 <- T40 %>% arrange(date) %>%
    filter(!is.na(Return)) %>%
    mutate(YearMonth=format(date, "%Y%B"))

# Considering only indeces with data before 2008-01-01, and using this as common start date

T40_low <- T40 %>% group_by(Tickers) %>%
    filter(date<ymd(20080103)) %>%
   ungroup() %>%
    pull(Tickers) %>% unique() 
T40_high <- T40 %>% group_by(Tickers) %>% 
    filter(date>ymd(20211028)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% pull(Tickers) %>% unique()

T40 <- T40 %>% filter(Tickers %in% T40_low & Tickers %in% T40_high) %>%
    filter(date>ymd(20080101)) #%>% pull(Tickers) %>% unique() only 20 Tickers have data for full sample period (20080102:20211029)

```

After restricting observations to those only available for the full sample period, there are 20 tickers remaining, out of the initial 92. 

Another issue that was found was that many of the stocks experienced significant changes in their market capitalization over the sample period. Specifically, AMS (2016), GFI (2016/17), ANG (2018), EXX (2019), INP (2020), and INL (2020). The first four are all in the Resources sector, which could explain why their market capitalization decreased so much in similar periods (ie when commodity prices crashed), whilst the latter two are Financials, whose drop in market cap happened in the period of the COVID pandemic. 

These stocks that have some NA's as values for the Index_Name were all Large_Caps, after some period (where NA's present), they became Mid_Caps. Therefore need to classify them as such for the periods where information is missing. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
sum(is.na(T40$Index_Name)) # 340 missing values

T40 <- T40 %>% mutate(Size=coalesce(Index_Name, "Mid_Caps")) %>%
    select(-Index_Name)

sum(is.na(T40$Size)) # No missing values
```

Previously, there were 340 missing Index_Names. After classifying the missing stocks as mid_caps, there are none.

# Exploratory Analysis {-}

In this section, three figures are presented displaying the behavior of the returns series over time.

```{r, fig.cap="Returns by Sector"}

T40 %>% ggplot() + geom_line(aes(date, Return), color="steelblue", size=1.2, alpha=0.8) +fmxdat::theme_fmx() + fmxdat::fmx_cols() + facet_wrap(~Sector) + labs(x="Year")

```


```{r, fig.cap="Returns by Size"}

T40 %>% ggplot() + geom_line(aes(date, Return), color="steelblue", size=1.2, alpha=0.8) + fmxdat::theme_fmx() + fmxdat::fmx_cols() + facet_wrap(~Size) + labs(x="Year")

```

```{r, fig.cap="Returns by Index"}
T40 %>% select(date, SWIX, ALSI) %>%
  gather(Index, Return, -date) %>% ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(date, Return), color="steelblue", size=1.2, alpha=0.8) +
  fmxdat::theme_fmx() + fmxdat::fmx_cols() + facet_wrap(~Index) + 
  labs(x="Year")
```

# Stratification Analysis using USDZAR {-}

```{r, include=FALSE}
USDZAR <- USDZAR %>% filter(date>ymd(20080101)) %>% # need to restrict T40 data for Tickers that have data until this date.
    spread(Name, Price) %>% rename("USDZAR"= SouthAfrica_Cncy)
```

```{r, fig.cap="USDZAR Spot (2008-2021)"}
USDZAR %>% ggplot() + geom_line(aes(date, USDZAR)) + fmxdat::theme_fmx() + fmxdat::fmx_cols()+
    labs(x="Year", y="USDZAR Spot", subtitle="USDZAR Spot (2008-2021)")
```


```{r, include=FALSE}

ZARSD <- USDZAR %>% mutate(YearMonth=format(date, "%Y%B")) %>%
    group_by(YearMonth) %>% summarize(SD=sd(USDZAR)*sqrt(252)) %>% # 252 trading days in a year
    mutate(TopQtile=quantile(SD,0.8), BotQtile=quantile(SD,0.2))

Hi_Vol <- ZARSD %>% filter(SD>TopQtile) %>% pull(YearMonth)
Lo_Vol <- ZARSD %>% filter(SD<BotQtile) %>% pull(YearMonth)

```

```{r}
Vol_df <-list(Hi_Vol, Lo_Vol) 
data.frame(Vol_df) %>% kable(col.names=c("High_Volatility", "Low Volatility"), caption="Currency Volatility Months", format="html")
```

Comparing the relative performance of the two indexes during periods of currency volatility (as specified above).

```{r, include=FALSE}
T40_Indeces <- T40 %>% select(date, SWIX, ALSI) %>%
        gather(Index, Return, -date) %>% mutate(YearMonth=format(date, "%Y%B"))

Perf_Comparisons_Indeces <- function(T40_Indeces, YMs, Alias) {

    Unconditional_SD <- T40_Indeces %>% group_by(Index) %>%
        mutate(Full_SD=sd(Return)*sqrt(252)) %>% # 252 trading days p/year
        filter(YearMonth %in% YMs) %>%
        summarise(SD=sd(Return)*sqrt(252), across(.cols=starts_with("Full"), .fns=max)) %>%
        arrange(desc(SD)) %>% mutate(Period=Alias) %>%
        #group_by(Index) %>%
        mutate(Ratio=SD/Full_SD)
    Unconditional_SD
}

perf_hi_Indeces <- Perf_Comparisons_Indeces(T40_Indeces, YMs=Hi_Vol, Alias="High_Vol")
perf_lo_Indeces <- Perf_Comparisons_Indeces(T40_Indeces, YMs=Lo_Vol, Alias = "Low_Vol")

```

\newpage

## Results {-}


```{r}
perf_hi_Indeces %>% kable(caption="Index Performance: High Volatility",  format="html", digits=2)
```

From the index performance tables (Tables 2 & 3), one can see that, during periods of high currency volatility, the SWIX (J400) index exhibits higher volatility, whereas during periods of lower currency volatility, the ALSI (J200) has a lower volatility, as implied by the standard deviation.

```{r}
perf_lo_Indeces %>% kable(caption="Index Performance: Low Volatility",  format="html", digits=2)
```
